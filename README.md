**an automated method to classify five stages or Osteoarthritis accurately. **
Osteoarthritis (OA) of knee is most prevalent form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. The
protective cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones deteriorates over time, causing this condition. Although
OA can cause damage to any joint, the hands, hips, spine, and knees are the most common areas affected.
Osteoarthritis of the knee can be particularly crippling, causing pain, limited mobility, and a general decline in
quality of life. Early detection and management of the disease are crucial for slowing its progression, managing
pain, and maintaining joint function.
